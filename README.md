## ▶️ Getting started with development

### 🚰 Install dependencies

Clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
# First, install Poetry. On some operating systems you need to use `pip` instead of `pipx`
pipx install --upgrade poetry
poetry install --all-extras --with dev,docs
```

The main entry points are:

```bash
tidal_ng_dl/cli.py
tidal_ng_dl/gui.py
```

### 📺 GUI Builder

The GUI is build with `PySide6` using the [Qt Designer](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtdesigner-manual.html):

```bash
PYSIDE_DESIGNER_PLUGINS=tidal_dl_ng/ui pyside6-designer
```

After all changes are saved you need to translate the Qt Designer `*.ui` file into Python code, for instance:

```
pyside6-uic tidal_dl_ng/ui/main.ui -o tidal_dl_ng/ui/main.py
```

This needs to be done for each created / modified `*.ui` file accordingly.

### 🏗 Build the project

To build the project use this command:

```bash
# Install virtual environment and dependencies if not already done
make install
# Build macOS GUI
make gui-macos
# Check build output
ls dist/
```

See the `Makefile` for all available build commands.

The CI/CD pipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main, or when you create a new release.

## ❓ FAQ

### macOS Error Message: File/App is damaged and cannot be opened. You should move it to Trash

If you download an (unsigned) app from any source other than those that Apple seems suited, the application gets an extended attribute "com.apple.Quarantine". This triggers the message: "<application> is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin."

Remove the attribute and you can launch the application. [Source 1](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253714860?sortBy=rank) [Source 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/13vu7f3/app_is_damaged_and_cant_be_opened_error_on_ventura/)

```
sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/TIDAL-Downloader-NG.app/
```

Why is this app unsigned? Only developer enrolled in the paid Apple developer program are allowed to sign (legal) apps. Without this subscription app signing is not possible.

Gatekeeper really annoys you, and you like to disable it completely? Follow this [link](https://iboysoft.com/tips/how-to-disable-gatekeeper-macos-sequoia.html)

### My (Windows) antivirus app XYZ says the GUI version of this app is harmful

Short answer: It is a lie. Get rid of your antivirus app.

Long answer: See [here](https://github.com/exislow/tidal-dl-ng/issues/231)

### I get an error when `extract_flac` is enabled

Your `path_binary_ffmpeg` is probably wrong. Please read over and over again the help of this particular option until you get it right what path to put for `path_binary_ffmpeg`.
